You can then install the application using the following command:

FAQ
---

See [FAQ](FAQ.md) for more details.

TESTING
-------

Install additional composer packages:
* `php composer.phar require --dev "codeception/codeception: 1.8.*@dev" "codeception/specify: *" "codeception/verify: *"`

This application boilerplate use database in testing, so you should create three databases that are used in tests:
* `yii2_practical_unit` - database for unit tests;
* `yii2_practical_functional` - database for functional tests;
* `yii2_practical_acceptance` - database for acceptance tests.

To make your database up to date, you can run in needed test folder `yii migrate`, for example
if you are starting from `frontend` tests then you should run `yii migrate` in each suite folder `acceptance`, `functional`, `unit`
it will upgrade your database to the last state according migrations.

To be able to run acceptance tests you need a running webserver. For this you can use the php builtin server and run it in the directory where your main project folder is located. For example if your application is located in `/www/practical` all you need to is:
`cd /www` and then `php -S 127.0.0.1:8080` because the default configuration of acceptance tests expects the url of the application to be `/practical/`.
If you already have a server configured or your application is not located in a folder called `practical`, you may need to adjust the `TEST_ENTRY_URL` in `frontend/tests/_bootstrap.php` and `backend/tests/_bootstrap.php`.

After that is done you should be able to run your tests, for example to run `frontend` tests do:

* `cd frontend`
* `../vendor/bin/codecept build`
* `../vendor/bin/codecept run`

In similar way you can run tests for other application tiers - `backend`, `console`, `common`.

You also can adjust you application suite configs and `_bootstrap.php` settings to use other urls and files, as it is can be done in `yii2-basic`.
